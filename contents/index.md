### What Is This? ###

A list of well-known CDN-hosted locations for common libraries like **jQuery**, **SWFObject** and others.

Instead of deploying and serving your own `jquery.min.js` just copy-paste one of the link URLs into your `script` tag `src`.

### Why? ###

Using a centrally-hosted CDN location for common client-side libraries like jQuery is [popular and highly recommended](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2180391/why-should-i-use-googles-cdn-for-jquery).

Let the user's browser get standard code from an optimized well-known location provided by a giant like Google, Microsoft, MediaTemple and others. In fact, the browser will likely already have a downloaded + cached copy!
